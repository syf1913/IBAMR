<h2>Incompatibilities</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Changed: The implementation of FORWARD_EULER provided by
IBExplicitHierarchyIntegrator was misnamed as it was actually the same 'explicit
backward Euler' (i.e., a forward Euler prediction followed by a backward Euler
correction) predictor-corrector method as BACKWARD_EULER. FORWARD_EULER is now
really the forward Euler method. The previous implementation is still available
as BACKWARD_EULER.

</li>
<li>
Removed: IBTK::LMarker and related functions and files have been removed from
the library. This marker class was never fully implemented and its
fully-functional replacement is IBTK::MarkerPatchHierarchy.
<br>
(David Wells, 2023/05/06)
</li>
<li>
Changed: Some functions in IBTK::HierarchyMathOps previously gained the ability
to interpolate data from ghost regions into ghost regions. These functions have
now been renamed as interp_ghosted() and harmonic_interp_ghosted() to
distinguish them from the interpolation functions which update the destination
coarse-fine interface.
<br>
(David Wells, 2023/05/09)
</li>
<li>
Changed: Several solver classes inheriting from GeneralSolver now store their
scratch vectors with the new IBTK::SAMRAIScopedVectorCopy or
IBTK::SAMRAIScopedVectorDuplicate classes instead of using SAMRAIVectorReal
directly.

<h2>Major Changes</h2>
<ol>
<li>
New: Added a class MarkerPatchHierarchy for tracking marker points.
<br>
(David Wells, 2023/04/21)
</li>
<li>
New: IBExplicitHierarchyIntegrator can now be set up to use markers to trace the
evolution of the fluid. IBFE example 4 (and its input2d.markers input file)
demonstrates how to do this.
<br>
(David Wells, 2023/05/01)
</li>
<li>
New: Added an option to IIMethod to represent the jump fields plus the traction
by discontinuous MONOMIAL or L2_LAGRANGE family. They will be used for
structures with sharp corners/edges and are tested for IIM/ex1 flow past a
square block (2D and 3D), IIM/ex3 flow past a thin swimming airfoil, IIM/ex6 the
Turek-Hron benchmark, and IIM/ex9 flexible plate inside the flow phantom.

<h2>Minor Changes</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Removed: IBHierarchyIntegrator no longer does an additional data redistribution
prior to the first timestep.
<br>
(David Wells, 2023/03/23)
</li>
<li>
Improved: IBTK::SAMRAIGhostDataAccumulator now logs how much time it uses via tbox::TimerManager.
<br>
(David Wells, 2023/04/11)
</li>
<li>
Fixed: Regridding issues with AdvDiffHierarchyIntegrator and other solvers when
the number of patch levels changes.
<br>
(Amneet Bhalla and Boyce Griffith, 2023/05/01)
</li>
<li>
New: added two new classes SAMRAIScopedVectorCopy and
SAMRAIScopedVectorDuplicate to enable usage of SAMRAI vectors with RAII
semantics.
<br>
(David Wells, 2023/05/04)
</li>
<li>
Improved: The staggered Navier-Stokes integrator now saves pressure fields, for
visualization, as node-centered data. This produces much nicer looking plots.
<br>
(David Wells, 2023/05/09)
</li>
<li>
Added: RK1 and RK2 integrator schemes for the RelaxationLSMethod. Corresponding
test added in tests/level_set.
