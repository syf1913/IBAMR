<h2>Incompatibilities</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Changed: INSStaggeredHierarchyIntegrator now outputs pressure, velocity, and vorticity data as a nodal, not cell-centered, fields.
<br>
(David Wells, 2022/10/03)
</li>
<li>
Changed: The function signature of HierarchyMathOps::curl() for side-valued input and nodal output
has been incompatibly changed to allow for setting source and destination data synchronization.
<br>
(David Wells, 2022/11/15)
</li>
<li>
Changed API: Global static system names for IBFEMethod and related classes are deprecated.
Methods are now provided by classes FEMechanicsBase, IBFEMethod, and FEDataManager to access
system names for key libMesh systems maintained by those classes.

<h2>Major Changes</h2>
<ol>
<li>
New: Implementations of analytically divergence-free interpolation and spreading kernels.
<br>
(Boyce Griffith, 2022/10/27)
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Minor Changes</h2>
<ol>
<li>
New: Added new functions for interpolating from side- or face-centered data to
nodal data.
<br>
(David Wells, 2022/10/03)
</li>
<li>
Fixed: Several bugs in IBFEInstrumentPanel have been fixed; the class now works correctly.
<br>
(Boyce Griffith, Charles Puelz, David Wells, 2022/10/26)
</li>
<li>
Improved: A node-centered curl operator is now provided in 3D and used for vorticity output for INSStaggeredHierarchyIntegrator.
<br>
(Boyce Griffith, 2022/10/30)
</li>
<li>
Fixed: IBFEInstrumentPanel generates perimeter curves in a more robust and consistent way.
<br>
(Boyce Griffith, Charles Puelz, 2022/11/02)
</li>
<li>
Improved: IBFEInstrumentPanel now reports pressures at the centroids of the meter meshes.
<br>
(Boyce Griffith, David Wells, 2022/11/02)
</li>
<li>
Improved: Add SPP-RK3 implementations to the explict FE mechanics solver.
<br>
(Boyce Griffith, 2022/11/15)
</li>
<li>
Improved: Improved support for damping in the explicit FE mechanics solver.
<br>
(Boyce Griffith, 2022/11/17)
</li>
<li>
New: IBAMR provides an example of how to implement a DLM FSI scheme for elastic structures (in examples/DLM/ex0).
