<h2>Incompatibilities</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Removed: IBTK::FEDataManager::buildL2ProjectionSolver() has been removed in
favor of using the IBTK::FEProjector class directly.
<br>
(David Wells, 2021/03/30)
</li>
<li>
Changed: The way IBAMR::IBFEMethod sets up its scratch hierarchy has been
completely changed. As a result the exact distribution of work in parallel is
now slightly different.
<br>
(David Wells, 2021/05/17)
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Major Changes</h2>
<ol>
<li>
New: Added an IBLevelSet example of an oscillating cylinder.
<br>
(Kaustubh Khedkar, 2021/03/04)
</li>
<li>
New: Added IBTK::SecondaryHierarchy, which manages a PatchHierarchy object which
occupies the same index space with a different parallel partitioning. Previously
this functionality was hard-coded into the IBFEMethod class.
<br>
(David Wells, 2021/05/17)
</li>
<li>
New: IBMethod and GeneralizedIBMethod now support structural body forces.
<br>
(Boyce Griffith, 2021/05/29)
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Minor Changes</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Fixed: Zero-displacement constraints added to the finite element matrices now
work correctly again.
<br>
(David Wells, 2021/03/01)
</li>
<li>
Bug fix: Correct the calculations of COM, MOI and associated quantities in the ConstraintIB method in the presence of periodic boundary.
<br>
(Hong Nguyen, 2020/12/01)
</li>
<li>
Fixed: IBTK::FEMapping (and, consequently, the rest of the IB stack) now works
correctly with QNODAL.
<br>
(David Wells, 2021/01/22)
</li>
<li>
Fixed: IBTK::HierarchyIntegrator now properly traverses child integrators
during regridHierarchy().
<br>
(Aaron Barrett, 2021/05/27)
</li>
<li>
Bug Fix: Filling ghost cells for levelset in demarcateBrinkmanZone function in BrinkmanPenalizationRigidBodyDynamics class.
<br>
(Ramakrishnan Thirumalaisamy, 2021/06/01)
</li>
<li>
Bug Fix: Computing cell-center locations and cell index using grid_lower_X rather than patch_lower_X in all Brinkman adv diff examples and tests to avoid processor dependent results.

New: In IndexUtilities class, new rouine is added to get side-center coordinates using grid_lower_X.

<br>
(Ramakrishnan Thirumalaisamy, 2021/06/21)
</li>
<li>
Improved: FEMechanicsBase (and therefore IBFEMethod) will evaluate all PK1
functions corresponding to the same registered libMesh systems and quadrature
rules inside a single loop, rather than independently looping over each PK1
function independently. This essentially eliminates the overhead of using
multiple PK1 stress functions.
<br>
(David Wells, 2021/07/06)
</li>
<li>
Fixed: FEDataManager now works correctly if all the block ids in a mesh are
greater than 256.
<br>
(David Wells, 2021/07/08)
</li>
<li>
New: GitHub actions are used to build each pull request and
push referencing the master branch to verify that (at least
on linux) the project builds.
<br>
(David Thompson, 2021/07/12)
</li>
<li>
New: Configure, build, and test stages are now separate
steps in the Github action and submit data to a
<a href="https://open.cdash.org/index.php?project=IBAMR">
cdash dashboard</a>.
