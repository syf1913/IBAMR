<h2>Incompatibilities</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Changed: IBTK_MPI's unused MPI type aliases have been removed.
Additionally, the optional communicator arguments have been removed.
This change was necessary to prevent a type conversion error that caused
compilation issues with versions of MPI that use unsigned int for MPI_Comm.

<h2>Major Changes</h2>
<ol>
<li>
New: Implementation of the Immersed Interface Method (IIM) in IBAMR.

<h2>Minor Changes</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Improved: IBAMR no longer depends on LAPACK.
<br>
(David Wells, 2021/09/03)
</li>
<li>
Changed: The eel3d example no longer depends on GSL.
<br>
(David Wells, 2021/10/01)
</li>
<li>
Improved: Classes inheriting from IBStrategy now check, in their constructors,
that they are using supported kernels instead of the internal functions checking
kernel names every time they are called. This greatly improves performance for
applications that call the spread or interpolate functions in loops (e.g., over
elements).
<br>
(David Wells, 2021/10/18)
</li>
<li>
Fixed: The autotools build system now correctly treats tests/attest.conf.in as a
configured file. This gets around a problem where this file could get out of date
and become invalid when attest was updated but this file was not.
<br>
(David Wells, 2021/10/22)
</li>
<li>
Added a fully Eulerian version of examples/IBLevelSet/ex0 (a half-buoyant cylinder impacting air-water interface) in examples/IBLevelSet/ex2.
<br>
(Amneet Bhalla, 2021/10/22)
</li>
<li>
Improved: IBTK::FEProjector now logs solve times for each libMesh system.
<br>
(David Wells, 2021/12/15)
</li>
<li>
Fixed: IBAMR now uses appropriate comparisons that respect finite precision.
